This study is driven by the crucial need for clean and safe drinking water, as well as the need to precisely forecast water quality to achieve this. By developing a machine learning-based approach to predict water quality using treatment plant data, this project has the potential to help water treatment plants optimise their processes and reduce the risk of producing non-drinkable water, thereby improving the quality of life for millions of people who rely on clean water. This study is significant because it has the potential to enhance the science of water quality prediction while simultaneously addressing a pressing demand for clean drinking water.
